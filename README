nginx_substitutions_filter
    *Note: this module is not distributed with the Nginx source.
    Installation instructions can be found below.*

  Description
    nginx_substitutions_filter is a filter module that can do both regular
    expression and fixed string substitutions on response bodies. This
    module is quite different from the Nginx's native Substitution Module.
    It scans the output chains buffer and matches string line by line, just
    like Apache's mod_substitute
    (<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_substitute.html>).

  Example
    location / {

        subs_filter_types text/html text/css text/xml;
        subs_filter st(\d*).example.com $1.example.com ir;
        subs_filter a.example.com s.example.com;
        subs_filter http://$host https://$host;
    }

  Directives
    *   subs_filter_types

    *   subs_filter

   subs_filter_types
    syntax: *subs_filter_types mime-type [mime-types] *

    default: *subs_filter_types text/html*

    context: *http, server, location*

    *subs_filter_types* is used to specify which content types should be
    checked for *subs_filter*, in addition to *text/html*. The default is
    only *text/html*.

    This module just works with plain text. If the response is compressed,
    it can't uncompress the response and will ignore this response. This
    module can be compatible with gzip filter module. But it will not work
    with proxy compressed response. You can disable the compressed response
    like this:

    proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding "";

   subs_filter
    syntax: *subs_filter source_str destination_str [gior] *

    default: *none*

    context: *http, server, location*

    *subs_filter* allows replacing source string(regular expression or
    fixed) in the nginx response with destination string. The variables 
    in matching text is only avaiable under fixed string mode, which means 
    the matching text could not contain variables if it is a regular 
    expression. Substitution text may contain variables. More than one 
    substitution rules per location is supported. 
    The meaning of the third flags are:

    *   *g*(default): Replace all the match strings.

    *   *i*: Perform a case-insensitive match.

    *   *o*: Just replace the first one.

    *   *r*: The pattern is treated as a regular expression, default is
        fixed string.

   subs_filter_bypass
    syntax: *subs_filter_bypass $variable1 ...*

    default: *none*

    context: *http, server, location*

    You can specify several variables with this directive. If at least one
    of the variable is not empty and is not equal to '0', this substitution
    filter will be disabled.
